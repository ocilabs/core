= Introduction

Over the last two decades Cloud Computing has revolutionized the technological landscape, allowing companies to rent infrastructure instead of buidling rapidly-obsolescing hardware on-site. During this time, the architectual approach that combines infrastructure orchestration and application code into cloud services has evolved. Today, cloud user have a choice between technology stacks for virtual hosts, master-slave architectures and container cluster. Each stack wraps application code differently, relies on different methods to launch server and provides different mechansims to automate fail-over and scaling processes. For Enterprise IT organizations, managing a large variety of applications, choosing one particular stack is ususally not sufficient, because a single stack can not address the broad variety of functional and non-functional requirements. Multi-cloud, hence spreading workloads accross multiple cloud provider is a common strategy to address this constrain. However, deploying private workloads accross multiple public infrastructure stacks increases operational complexity significantly and comes with certain vulnaribilities. Adopting a second generation infrastructure service (IaaS) like {oci-cloud}[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)] is an attractive alternative. Purpose build hardware enables cloud providers to separate the orchestration layer from the hosts and allows cloud customers to build private data centers on prebuild infrastructure pools. Programming interfaces allow operators to build extensible service delivery platforms and service owners to modernize applications in incremental steps. The bare metal approach allows to run enterprise applications in a traditional way. Cloud ochstrators remain optional and can be added as managed service, but even than the user remain in control over the infrastructure resources.

Oracle operates a fast growing network of data centre to provide access to prebuild cloud infrastructure in more than 30 regions. In addition, Oracle builds private infrastructure pools on-demand and offers to extend these pools with edge compute or database nodes. In every data center, dedicated compute- and storage resources are isolated on a native layer three network. Orchstrators incl. hypervisor, container and network functions remain private by default - also in shared pools. Combining on open-source orchestration technologies with cloud agnostic monitoring and management services allows operators to build a control center for hybrid cloud services. End to end programmability ensures fast and flexible resource deployments, with platform components like middleware, integration and database infrastructure, provided either as managed or as unmanaged service to offer a choice between convenience and control. In any case, standard hardware controls like the {oci-ilom}[integrated lights out manager (ILOM)] and {oci-offbox}[off-box vitrualization] allow to address regional privacy regulations and compliance requirements. This framework targets operation engineers who aim to use OCI for as virtual data center.

Cloud operations engineering is a relatively new field extending the scope of IT service management (ITSM). It represents an important step towards more agility and flexibilty in service operation. The concept of "Infrastructure as Code" replaces runbook tools and has become an enabler for self-service delivery - even for complex solution architectures. Operators empower service owners and developers to add, change or delete infrastructure on demand with deployment templates for logical resources. Service consumers gain flexibility to provision virtual infrastructure while resource operators remain in control of the physical infrastructure. This repository aims to provide a path for IT Organizations introducing cloud engineering. We starts with a short introduction about Infrastructure as Code, show how to define logical resources for application and database services and end with as an example how to consolidate infrastructure and application services in a self-service catalogue. We build on the official {oci-training}[Oracle Cloud Architect training], that prepares administrators for the {oci-certification}[Oracle Architect Associate exam], but aim to extend the {oci-learning}[Learning Path], with tool recommendations and code examples for cloud engineers.
